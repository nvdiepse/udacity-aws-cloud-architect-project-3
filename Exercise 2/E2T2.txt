Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
 
1. IAM policy does not follow the least privilege principle, allowing full access to resources. 
2. Don't use the root account
3. CloudTrail Trail is not specified.
4. ALB moves HTTP->HTTPS for requests
5. VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation.
6. TCP with port 5000 is reachable from the internet on the EC2 instance
7. SSE and logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
 
Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities
 
1. Set IAM policies for not allowing root users, enforce MFA, and the specific permissions.
2. Create a CloudTrail that is stored on S3.
3. Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
4. Limit the traffic on the Security Groups to only allow 80 and 443 and reference the other security groups for accessing AWS resources within VPC.
5. Disable all other non-necessary ports on the EC2 instance.
6. Enable S3 SSE and Log
