# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Add Amazon CloudFront in front of the load balancer and enforce a rule that requires all SSH access to instances to be conducted through AWS Systems Manager. This approach eliminates direct external access to the instances.


 
# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, creating VPC private endpoints alone would not prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket if the IAM permissions are still insecure.
 
# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, applying default encryption settings will only affect new objects uploaded to the bucket. Existing data will remain unencrypted unless you manually re-upload or update it.
 
# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Applying the original CloudFormation templates would override any configurations made directly through the AWS Management Console, resetting the environment to match the settings specified in the templates.
